# WorkAroundSelfCast

## How To Install
Extract the downloaded files so that you have a folder simply called 'WorkAroundSelfCast' inside of /World of Warcraft/Interface/AddOns/
Make sure that the folder is called like this and remove the '-master' if existing. The folder should have the files displayed in this repository: WorkAroundSelfCast.toc and main.lua

## Supported AddOns
* PallyPower
* Decursive

## How to Contribute
